    "# Basic BCI Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorization of cognitive states in real time is important for effective BCI. Here we demonstrate a basic machine learning categorization technique to distinguish between two different thinking tasks. We will show the machine two different brain activities and train a machine learning model. We can then show the machine new data, in real time, and the model will predict which thinking task it is. The support vector machine (ML) is only looking to distinguish between the states, so we donâ€™t get any information about what these states are. Rather, the computer should tell us which state the subject is in, so long as the brain processes associated with each task are significant. "
